# do-test
Hey :)     
I was about to practice some questions at the end of the book English Grammar In Use.
So i thought of a good idea of writing a program for that.
Both to practice my grammar and to practice my coding skills. Then i wrote this.

This program consists of two part: 1) Creating test sheets  2) Taking tests    
In two types we could create test sheets 1) test sheets without limit in the number of alternatives
and true alternatives. This is because of the type of the questions in my grammar book.      
2) This is a specific version of the first type of test sheets that is more common in doing tests.
For each question 4 alternatives and 1 true alternative.

After each test, the program creates two files, one for scores results
and another for wrong answered questions.

As far as i could, i've tried to simulate the real test-doing. so at any time you can
go back and modify your previously ticked questions!

For sure this is a useful program for me and anybody who wants to do test efficiently.
Thanks for reading this text!
